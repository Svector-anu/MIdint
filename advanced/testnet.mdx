## Transitioning to Public Testnet

While Regtest is great for fast iterations, deploying to the Public Testnet is the final step before Mainnet. This guide covers the differences and requirements.

### 1. Network Configuration

Update your `.env` and `hardhat.config.ts` to include the Testnet RPC.

```bash
# .env
RPC_URL="https://rpc.testnet.midl.xyz"
```

### 2. Obtaining Testnet BTC

On Testnet, you need real Testnet Bitcoin (tBTC) to pay for gas. You can get this from the official MIDL Testnet Faucet:

### 3. Deployment Command

To deploy to Testnet, simply change the network flag:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network midlTestnet
```

### 4. Public Verification

Transactions on Testnet are visible to everyone. Use the Public Testnet Explorer to verify your deployments:

## Best Practices for Testnet

- **Gas Management**: Gas fees are more critical on Testnet. Optimize your contract interactions to minimize costs.
- **Contract Verification**: Always verify your contracts on the public explorer so community members can test your app.
- **Persistent State**: Unlike Regtest, Testnet state is persistent. Be careful with deployments as you cannot simply "reset" the network.
