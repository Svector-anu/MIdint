## Common Issues and Solutions

Building on Bitcoin L1 with EVM compatibility brings some unique challenges. Here are the most common issues developers face and how to fix them.

### 1. "Insufficient Funds" Error

**Symptoms:** The transaction fails with an "insufficient funds for gas * price + value" error.

**Cause:** Your wallet address does not have enough native BTC to cover the gas fees for the EVM transaction.

**Solution:** 
- On **Regtest**: Use the deployer wallet (which is pre-funded) to send BTC to your user address.
- On **Testnet**: Use the [MIDL Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.midl.xyz).

### 2. "No intentions to execute"

**Symptoms:** Your script runs but nothing seems to happen, and you see this message in the logs.

**Cause:** You queued intentions using `hre.midl.execute({...})` but forgot to call the final `await hre.midl.execute()`.

**Solution:** Ensure every script that performs writes ends with a call to the execution handler.

### 3. Frontend Transaction Fails (Zeroed Parameters)

**Symptoms:** Transactions from the browser fail with "Missing or invalid parameters" or showing all zeros for `btcTxHash`.

**Cause:** The `WagmiMidlProvider` is either missing from the React tree or misconfigured with the wrong chain object.

**Solution:** 
- Ensure `WagmiMidlProvider` wraps your `WagmiConfig`.
- Pass the correct `midlRegtest` or `midlTestnet` chain object from `@midl/executor`.

### 4. "INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY"

**Symptoms:** Swap transactions fail with this Uniswap error.

**Cause:** You are trying to swap for more tokens than the pool currently holds, or the pool has not been seeded with liquidity yet.

**Solution:** 
- Run the `AddLiquidity` tag: `npx hardhat deploy --tags AddLiquidity --network default`.
- Check the pool reserves in the frontend or via console.
