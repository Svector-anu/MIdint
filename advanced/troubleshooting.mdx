## Common Issues

### ❌ "No intentions to execute"
**Cause**: The transactions may have already been executed, or the runtime environment was cleared.
**Fix**: Ensure you have queued intentions using `hre.midl.execute({...})` before calling the general `hre.midl.execute()` command.

### ❌ "Insufficient allowance"
**Cause**: You are trying to add liquidity or swap without approving the Router first.
**Fix**: Run the `TestDex` script or manually execute an `approve` intention for the token in question.

### ❌ "Out of Gas"
**Cause**: Your EVM address (0x...) doesn't have enough native BTC to cover gas fees.
**Fix**: Use the deployer wallet to send a small amount of BTC to your address via `deployer.sendTransaction`.
