## Expanding the Ecosystem

The MidInt DEX is built on the Uniswap V2 architecture, which means it can support any standard ERC20 token. This guide explains how to deploy your own token and create a trading pair for it.

### 1. Deploying a New Token

You can use the `TestToken.sol` contract as a template for your own tokens.

```bash
# Deploys a new token using the deploy script
npx hardhat deploy --tags MyNewToken --network default
```

### 2. Creating a Trading Pair

To trade your new token against TBTC, you must first create a pair using the Factory contract.

```javascript
const factory = await ethers.getContractAt("UniswapV2Factory", FACTORY_ADDRESS);
await factory.createPair(NEW_TOKEN_ADDRESS, TBTC_ADDRESS);
```

### 3. Adding Initial Liquidity

A pair exists but has no price until liquidity is added. You must deposit both tokens in the desired ratio.

<Warning>
**Initial Price**: The first person to add liquidity sets the initial price. Ensure you are depositing the correct ratio of tokens.
</Warning>

### 4. Integration Checklist

When adding a new token to your frontend, remember to:
1. Update your `constants/tokens.ts` with the new address.
2. Add the token's icon/logo assets.
3. Ensure the decimals are correctly handled (standard is 18, but TBTC uses 8).

## Example: Deploying "GOLD" Token

Check out `contracts/deploy/00_deploy_tokens.ts` to see how we deployed TBTC and WBTC. You can follow that pattern to add as many tokens as you want!
