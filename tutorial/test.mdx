## Minting Test Tokens

Before you can trade, you need tokens! We've included a faucet script to make this easy.

### 1. Run the Faucet

Execute the faucet tag to mint 1,000 TBTC to your wallet:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --tags Faucet --network default
```

### 2. Execute the DEX Test

Now, let's run a full automated test that performs approvals, adds liquidity, and does a swap—all in one go.

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --tags TestDex --network default
```

<img src="/docs/screenshots/02_testdex_output.png" alt="DEX Test Terminal Output" />

### What did the test do?

1.  **Approved** the Router to spend your TBTC and WBTC.
2.  **Added** 100 TBTC and 1 WBTC into the liquidity pool.
3.  **Swapped** 10 TBTC for WBTC to test the pricing math.

## Let's see it on-chain
The final step is verifying that these transactions actually happened on the Bitcoin blockchain.
