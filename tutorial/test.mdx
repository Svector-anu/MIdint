## Testing Trading Functionality

Once your contracts are deployed, it's time to verify that everything works as expected. We've provided scripts to simulate the entire DEX lifecycle: minting, approving, adding liquidity, and swapping.

### 1. Minting Test Tokens (Faucet)

To perform any trades, your wallet needs tokens. Use the internal faucet script to mint 1,000 TBTC to your deployer address.

```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat deploy --tags Faucet --network default
```

### 2. The Complete DEX Flow

We've created a comprehensive test script that performs a full end-to-end flow. This is the best way to verify your setup.

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --tags TestDex --network default
```

**What this script does:**
1. **Approve**: Grants the Router permission to spend your TBTC and WBTC.
2. **Add Liquidity**: Deposits tokens into the TBTC/WBTC pool.
3. **Swap**: Performs a swap of TBTC for WBTC.

### 3. Manual Testing via Console

If you want to interact with the contracts manually, you can use the Hardhat console:

```bash
npx hardhat console --network default
```

Example: Checking your TBTC balance
```javascript
const tbtc = await ethers.getContractAt("TestToken", "YOUR_TBTC_ADDRESS");
const balance = await tbtc.balanceOf("YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS");
console.log(ethers.utils.formatUnits(balance, 8));
```

## Technical Verification

After running the tests, you should verify the transactions on the blockchain.
