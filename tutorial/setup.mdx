## Getting Your Environment Ready

Before you can build on Bitcoin with MidInt, you need to set up your development environment. We'll use modern tools that make smart contract development seamless.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

  <Card title="Node.js 18+" icon="node-js" href="https://nodejs.org">
    The runtime for our development tools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="pnpm" icon="box-open" href="https://pnpm.io">
    A fast, disk space efficient package manager.
  </Card>

### 1. Clone the Starter Kit

Start by cloning the MidInt repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/svector-anu/midint.git
cd midint
```

### 2. Install Project Dependencies

The project is split into two main parts: `contracts` and `frontend`. You'll need to install dependencies for both.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Contracts
cd contracts
pnpm install
```

```bash Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm install
```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Configure Your Wallet

MidInt uses a mnemonic-based wallet system for deployments and testing. You'll need a 12-word recovery phrase (mnemonic).

<Warning>
**Safety First!** Always use a dedicated test wallet for development. Never use a mnemonic that holds real Bitcoin or significant assets.
</Warning>

Create a `.env` file in the `contracts` directory:

```bash
cd contracts
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and add your mnemonic:

```bash
MNEMONIC="your twelve word test wallet mnemonic goes here"
RPC_URL="https://rpc.regtest.midl.xyz"
```

### 4. Get Testnet Funds

To pay for gas fees on MidInt, you need testnet BTC. You can get some from the official faucet:

[https://faucet.regtest.midl.xyz/](https://faucet.regtest.midl.xyz/)

Enter your Bitcoin address (you can find it by running `npx hardhat console` as shown above) and request funds.

To ensure everything is working correctly, try running the Hardhat help command:

```bash
npx hardhat help
```

If you see a list of available tasks, you're ready to go!
