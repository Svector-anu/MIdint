## Let's get your workspace ready!

Before we write any code, we need to make sure your machine has the right tools.

### 1. Install Dependencies

In your terminal, navigate to the `contracts` folder and install the core tools:

```bash
cd contracts
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Your Wallet

We need a "Secret Recovery Phrase" (Mnemonic) to sign transactions on the MIDL network.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create .env">
    Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Mnemonic">
    Open `.env` in your editor and add your 12-word phrase:
    ```bash
    MNEMONIC="your twelve word secret phrase here"
    RPC_URL="https://rpc.regtest.midl.xyz"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Security Warning**: This `.env` file contains your private keys. It is included in `.gitignore` so it won't be pushed to GitHub, but always keep it safe!
</Warning>

### 3. Check Your Address

MIDL uses a derived EVM address from your Bitcoin wallet. Let's find yours:

```bash
npx hardhat console --network default
```

Inside the console, run:
```javascript
const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
console.log("Your EVM Address:", deployer.address);
```

<Tip>
  Save this address! You'll use it to check your balances on the blockchain explorer.
</Tip>

## Ready for deployment?

Now that your environment is configured, let's deploy the DEX contracts to Bitcoin!
