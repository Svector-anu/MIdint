## Deploying to Bitcoin L1

MidInt uses `hardhat-deploy` to manage contract deployments. Deploying to MidInt is very similar to deploying to Ethereum, but the transactions are ultimately settled on the Bitcoin blockchain.

### Deployment Architecture

Our deployment process is broken down into several modular scripts located in `contracts/deploy/`. This allows for selective deployment and better management.

- `00_deploy_tokens`: Deploys TBTC and WBTC.
- `02_deploy_factory`: Deploys the Uniswap V2 Factory.
- `03_deploy_router`: Deploys the Uniswap V2 Router.
- `04_create_pair`: Creates the initial TBTC/WBTC trading pair.
- `05_add_liquidity`: Seeds the pool with initial liquidity.

### 1. The Deployment Command

To deploy everything to the default MidInt Regtest network, run:

```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network default
```

<Tip>
The `default` network in our config is mapped to MidInt Regtest.
</Tip>

### 2. Verifying Deployment Success

After the script finishes, you will see a summary of deployed contracts and their addresses. You should save these addresses as you'll need them for your frontend configuration.

### 3. Deployment Tags

You can use tags to deploy specific components. For example, if you only want to deploy the tokens:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --tags Tokens --network default
```

Commonly used tags in this project:
- `Tokens`: TBTC and WBTC
- `Factory`: Uniswap V2 Factory
- `Router`: Uniswap V2 Router
- `Setup`: Complete DEX setup (Factory + Router + Pair + Liquidity)

## What Just Happened?

When you run these commands:
1. Hardhat compiles your Solidity contracts.
2. The deployment scripts interact with the MidInt RPC.
3. MidInt wraps these EVM transactions into Bitcoin-compatible intentions.
4. Your contracts are now live on Bitcoin L1!
