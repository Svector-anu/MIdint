## Visualizing the DEX

While backend scripts are the most reliable way to interact with Bitcoin L1 today, we've provided a React frontend so you can see your data in a clean UI.

### 1. Launch the App

Navigate to the frontend folder and start the dev server:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 2. Key Pages

<Note>
  **Important Note**: The current frontend is optimized for **visualization**. For executing write transactions, we recommend staying with the Hardhat scripts to ensure total reliability with MIDL intentions.
