## The Source of Truth

Because MIDL is EVM-compatible, we can use traditional blockchain explorers like **Blockscout** to see everything happening on Bitcoin L1.

### 1. Open Explorer

Navigate to the Regtest Explorer:
[blockscout.regtest.midl.xyz](https://blockscout.regtest.midl.xyz)

### 2. Search Your Address

Paste your EVM address into the search bar. You should see:
