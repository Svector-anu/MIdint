## Transparency on Bitcoin L1

Every swap, mint, and deployment you perform using MidInt is a verifiable transaction on the Bitcoin network. We use Blockscout to provide a human-readable interface for this data.

### 1. Finding Your Address

After running your tests or deployments, copy your wallet address.

### 2. Using the Explorer

Go to the MidInt Regtest Explorer:
[https://blockscout.regtest.midl.xyz](https://blockscout.regtest.midl.xyz)

Paste your address into the search bar.

### 3. Understanding the Data

In the address view, you can see:
- **Transaction History**: Every interaction you've had with the MidInt protocol.
- **Token Balances**: Your current holdings of TBTC, WBTC, and LP tokens.
- **Contract Internal Calls**: How the Router interacted with the Factory and Pairs.

### 4. Verifying Smart Contract Code

To allow others to interact with your contracts safely, you should verify the source code.

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network default DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor Argument 1"
```

Verified contracts will show a green checkmark check in Blockscout, and the "Contract" tab will display the readable Solidity code and ABI.
